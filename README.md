# Fortune

## Purpose

- Just a small widget app on my phone that will randomly select a reminder of something I want to focus on that day. Something like sitting up straight pr practicing something I learned from a book.
- The name is shamelessly stolen from the UNIX command `fortune` which I fondly remember having my terminal start-up be a cow telling me a random quote from a data-base. I'd like to do the same for my phone
